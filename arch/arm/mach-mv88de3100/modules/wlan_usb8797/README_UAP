	The driver code supports Linux kernel up to 3.4.

2) FOR DRIVER INSTALL

	a) Copy firmware image usb8786_uapsta.bin | ... to /lib/firmware/mrvl/ directory,
	   create the directory if it doesn't exist.
	b) Install uAP driver,
	   For example, to install USB8786 driver,
		insmod mlan.ko
		insmod usb8786.ko [fw_name=mrvl/usb8786_uapsta.bin]

4) SOFT_RESET command
   This command is used to perform a "soft reset" on the module.
   The FW code will disable hardware and jump to boot code.

	./uaputl.exe bss_config config/uaputl.conf
		Load BSS settings from uaputl.conf file and set.

sys_info
--------
    "./uaputl.exe sys_info"

    This command returns system information such as firmware version number
    and HW information.

sys_reset
---------
    "./uaputl.exe sys_reset"

    This command is used to reset the Micro AP back to its initial state.
    For example, this can be used to recover from a serious error, or before
    creating a new BSS.

    This command has the following effects:
        1. The WLAN hardware MAC is reset.
        2. All MIB variables are initialized to their respective default
           values.
        3. The firmware internal variables are reset to their respective
           default values.

    This command starts the BSS.
    There is no error for redundant bss_start command.

bss_stop
--------
    "./uaputl.exe bss_stop"

    This command stops the BSS. The command causes the firmware to:
        1. Deauthenticate all associated client stations.
        2. Turn off the radio (hence stopping beaconing).
    There is no error for redundant bss_stop command.
